(* In this section, we will program in System F using the IDE at
   https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse505/25sp/f/index.html

   When you open that page for the first time, you will see the following code:

   Id = forall A. A -> A;       # type abbreviation
   id = /\A. \x:A. x;           # term abbreviation
   id Id id;                    # evaluating a term to normal form

                                # annotation, which allows inference on the RHS

Syntax

The syntax of types and terms is similar to what is used in the slides and in
Week09.v.

Syntax of types
  - built-in boolean type is written "bool"
  - function types are written with "->", as in "bool -> bool"
  - type variables *must* be capitalized, as in "A"
  - polymorphic types are written with "forall", as in "forall A. A -> A"

Again, type variables must be capitalized.

The editor also supports a shorthand for types that quantify over multiple type
variables: "forall A B. A -> B" expands to "forall A. forall B. A -> B".

You can declare type abbreviations to avoid having to write out long types over
and over. The starter code above defines type abbreviations "Id" and "Nat". Note
that the name of a type abbreviation also must be capitalized.

Syntax of expressions
  - built-in boolean constants "true" and "false"
  - conditional expression "if ... then ... else ..."
  - lambda functions are written with "\" as in "\x:bool. x"
  - function application is written with a space between the function and
    argument, as in "(\x:bool. x) true"
  - big lambdas (bambdas) are written "/\", as in "/\A. \x:A. x".
  - type application is also written with a space, as in "id Id"

Term variables like "x" must be lowercase to distinguish them from type
variables.

You can declare term abbreviations to avoid having to write out long terms over
and over. The starter code above defines term abbreviations such as
"id = /\A. \x:A. x".  and "id2 : Id = /\A. \x. x".

Syntax of statements
  - all statements must end with a semicolon ";"
  - type abbreviation, as in "Id = forall A. A -> A;"
  - term abbreviation, as in "id = /\A. \x:A. x;" or with a type annotation, as
    in "id2 : Id = /\A. \x. x;"
  - normalize an expression by just writing the expression followed by a ";", as
    in "id Id id;"
  - a test statement starts with the keyword "test" and then takes two
    expressions, separated by an "=", and checks that they evaluate to the same
    thing, as in "test id Id id = id;"

In a term abbreviation, if you give a type annotation on the LHS of the "=", it
often allows you to leave off type annotations on lambdas on the RHS.

(*

The following problems ask you to write several programs in System F. We
recommend working in the editor and then copy-pasting your final code into this
file to turn it in.

*)

(* PROBLEM 3 [30 points, ~20 LOC]
 *
 * Programming with typed Church numerals
 *
 * a. Define "add" that takes two "Nat"s and computes their sum. Write at least
 *    one "test" to demonstrate that "add" works as intended.
 *
 * b. Define "mul" that takes two "Nat"s and computes their product. Write at
 *    least one "test" for "mul".
 *
 * c. Define "exp" that takes two "Nat"s base and exp and computes base to the
 *    power of exp. For instance, "exp two three" should give back "eight".
 *    Write at least one "test" for "exp".
 *
 * Hint: Some of these were done in class on Thursday. Others can be found in
 * the slides.
 *
 * Hint: When we report "lines of code" in our solution, don't take the numbers
 *       too literally. We tend to put a line break after an "=" in most
 *       definitions. If you follow different conventions, you might get a
 *       (very) different number of lines.

(* CHALLENGE 6 [10 points, ~35 LOC]
 *
 * Unlike UTLC, we cannot define arbitrary recursive functions in System F.
 * However, we can still write structurally recursive functions over Nats by
 * calling them. "Nat" is encoded such that function "s" is applied to "z" some
 * number of times, which behaves like a loop that executes the "body" n times.
 *
 * By default, calling a "Nat" gives you access to the "recursive call" as the
 * argument to "s", but it doesn't give "s" access to the Nat itself. We can use
 * the pair trick to keep track of the Nat, though.
 *
 * a. Define a function "natrec" that takes four arguments:
 *      - a type "A"
 *      - a function "f" of type "Nat -> A -> A",
 *      - a base case "x", and
 *      - a "Nat" "n"
 *    and computes the result of applying "f" to "x" "n" times, but where each
 *    call to "f" also gets "the current number" as its first argument.
 *
 *    For instance, "natrec f x 3" computes "f 2 (f 1 (f 0 x))".
 *
 *    Ensure the following test passes:
 *
 *        # you may need to define "three = succ two;" if you haven't already
 *        test natrec Nat (\x. \rec. mul (succ x) rec) one three = six;
 *
 *    Hint: Use the pair trick and keep track of the "current number" as well as
 *    the "recursive result".
 *
 * b. Use "natrec" to define a function "factorial" that takes a "Nat" "n" and
 *    computes the factorial of "n". (factorial of x is 1 * 2 * ... * x).
 *    Use "test" to show "factorial" works as intended.
 *
 * c. Define "natcase" to implement "pattern matching" on "Nat" without access
 *    to a recursive answer. (Similar to Definition vs Fixpoint in Rocq.)
 *
 *    Ensure the following tests pass:
 *
 *        is_zero : Nat -> bool = natcase bool (\_. false) true;
 *        test is_zero zero = true;
 *        test is_zero one = false;
 *        pred_again : Nat -> Nat = natcase Nat (\p. p) zero;
 *        test pred_again zero = zero;
 *        test pred_again one = zero;
 *        test pred_again two = one;
 *
 *    Hint: use "natrec" and ignore the recursive answer
 *
 * d. Write a function "le" that takes two "Nat"s x and y and returns a boolean
 *    indicating whether x <= y.
 *
 *    Ensure at least the following tests pass:
 *
 *        test le zero one = true;
 *        test le one zero = false;
 *
 *    Hint: There are several ways to implement it. One approach is to do
 *    structural recursion on x (i.e. call x as a function), and in the
 *    recursive case, do pattern matching on y (i.e. use "natcase").

 * Church lists
 *
 * We can encode lists whose elements have type "A" using the type
 *
 *     List A = forall B. (A -> B -> B) -> B -> B
 *
 * Why does this type represent lists? It is similar to how we represented
 * "Nat" as a function that applied "s" n times to "z". A list is represented
 * by calling "c" (for "cons") with each element of the list as its first
 * argument and the recursive answer as its second argument, with the base case
 * "n" (for "nil").
 *
 * For example, the list [1; 2; 3] would be represented by
 *
 *     /\B. \c. \n.
 *     c 1 (c 2 (c 3 n))
 *
 * (Of course, we also need to encode the numbers.)
 *
 * Here are a few helper functions you can copy-paste into your solution.
 *
 *     # analogous to zero for Nat
 *     nil : forall A. List A =
 *       /\A B. \c n. n;
 *
 *     # analogous to succ for Nat
 *     cons : forall A.
 *         A ->  # the element to put on the front
 *         List A ->  # the rest of the list
 *         List A =
 *       /\A. \a l. /\B. \c n.
 *         c a (l B c n);
 *
 *     # length is a structurally recursive function on lists, which means it
 *     # *calls the list* to do the recursion, just like with Nats.
 *     length : forall A. List A -> Nat =
 *       /\A. \l.
 *         l Nat (\_. succ) zero;
 *
 *     # some basic tests for length/cons/nil
 *     test length Nat (nil Nat) = zero;
 *     test length Nat (cons Nat zero (nil Nat)) = one;
 *     test length Nat (cons Nat zero (cons Nat one (nil Nat))) = two;
 *
 * In the problems below, we focus specifically on lists of "Nat", so we often
 * use the type "List Nat".
 *
 * a. Implement a function "seq" that takes a "Nat" "n" and computes a list
 *    of "Nat" "[zero; one; ...; n - 1]". Ensure that at least the following
 *    test passes:
 *
 *    # you may need to define "three = succ two;" if you haven't already
 *    test seq three = cons Nat zero (cons Nat one (cons Nat two (nil Nat)));
 *
 *    Hint: This one is a bit tricky. The easiest way is probably to use a
 *    modified pair trick that counts down instead of up.
 *
 * b. Implement a function "insert" that inserts a "Nat" into a "List Nat" such
 *    that if the second argument is sorted (in ascending order), then the
 *    resulting "List Nat" is also sorted in ascending order. Here is a test:
 *
 *    test insert one (cons Nat zero (cons Nat two (nil Nat))) = seq three;
 *
 * c. Use "insert" to implement "insertion_sort" that takes a "List Nat" and
 *    returns a sorted (in ascending order) "List Nat". Here is a test:
 *
 *    one_zero_two = cons Nat one (cons Nat zero (cons Nat two (nil Nat)));
 *    test insertion_sort one_zero_two = seq three;

 * How many closed values of type
 *     forall A. A -> A -> Pair A A
 * are there (up to equivalence)?
 *
 * Justify your answer briefly and informally using your intuition about
 * parametricity.
 *
 *)
(*
Prop. There are 4 values of the given type.

Proof.
The only operations available are placing the input arguments into each of the two positions of the pair.
Since each position can independently be filled with either the first or second argument, then we have 2 Ã— 2 = 4 possible functions of this type:
Î»x. Î»y. (x, x)
Î»x. Î»y. (x, y)
Î»x. Î»y. (y, x)
Î»x. Î»y. (y, y)

 * Suppose
 *     p : forall A. forall B. A -> B -> Pair A B
 * and
 *     f : forall A. forall B. Pair A B -> A
 * are *arbitrary* closed values with those respective types.
 *
 * Use your intuition about parametricity to informally argue that for all types
 * t1 and t2, and all values v1 and v2,
 *     f t1 t2 (p t1 t2 v1 v2) -->* v1
 *
 *)
(*
Note that p constructs a pair with one value up to equivalence.
Note that f is the first projection of a pair, also with one value up to equivalence.

Since p and f must work consistently across all types without inspecting values,
then the composition f . p must behave like the standard pair construction
followed by the first projection, which returns the first argument.
So, f . p will always return the first argument given to p, that is v1.

   1. 4 hours?

   2. Daniel-san really liked System F. lipson liked the metatheory proofs.
   We had the following realizations:
   - calling a natural number as a function is like performing induction, we need a step and a base case.
   - calling lists as a function is like folding with an accumulator.
